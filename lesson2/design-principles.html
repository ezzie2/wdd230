          Their design is pretty simple, but it provides a quick glimpse to
          their services. By using the black background they are able to point
          the user to what is important, like signing up with an email address.
          They area able to point out their services as well right away since
          the font is differnt sizes.

          The white space contained in this site provides focus. One is able to
          be guided to that which is important without having to be familiar
          with the site. Also, it is easy to follow along without been confused
          at the content given.

        The Hick's Law states that by having less one is able to make a choice.
        Cafe Rio's site does use this principle. As one makes a choice, it takes
        you to another section where you are given options. Some have more than
        others, but one is not innudiated with too many choices. The filters
        they use can be the type of food you want (Entree, Dessert, Appetizer,
        etc.).
